# Project-Lombok

Lombok is used to reduce the code for model/data objects.. eg, it can generate getters and setters for those object automatically by using Lombok annotations.
The easiest way is to use the @Data annotation.

Lombok provides a lot of annotations:
  1. @Data (At class level) - It generates getters, setters, hashcode, tostring, equals methods for all the instance variables.
  2. @Getter (At instance variable level)
  3. @Setter (At instance variable level)
  
  
  How to use it:
    1. Download "Lombok" jar from "https://projectlombok.org/download"
    2. Double click the jar
